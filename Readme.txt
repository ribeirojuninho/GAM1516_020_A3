Use Keyboard Controller:
X - Jump
S - Shoot
D - Dash
Keyboard LeftArrow - Move Left
Keyboard RightArrow - Move Right

You can shoot when idle or moving, use dash when idle or moving. Can't shoot and dash when jumping (sometimes the animation will trigger, but there is no action).

Be careful when jump, as I'm using a capsule component it will bounce when collide with the floor (sometimes you can jump really high because the bounce).

Play like any sidescroller, when you get to the end and touch an invisible wall you going to be teleported to the goalmap.

TY means Thank you!
